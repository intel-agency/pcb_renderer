I want you to guide me throught Implementation of the app described in the @docs/plan/ directory. Use the steps in the @docs/plan/walkthrus/DEVELOPMENT_WALKTHROUGH-claude.md doc ro present one step at a time. 

For each step present the info from the walkthru doc, explain what we are doing and walk me through follwoing all the directions in that step.  You can also include supplementaty info form the other docs  when it is relevanto the curtrent step (from @docs/plan/development_plan_v2.md @docs/plan/implementation_guide_v2.md @docs/plan/architecture_guide_v2.md @docs/plan/Application Implementation Specification_ PCB Renderer.md )

At the end, you will evaluate the reult using the info from the step details, the extra doc info, and esp. the acceptrance criteria. We will verify that everything added up to that step works before miving on.

Once we finsih the curtrtent step, you will present the enxt one.
